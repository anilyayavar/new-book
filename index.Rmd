# Preface {-}

>"R is the Swiss Army knife of data science. It's a versatile and powerful tool that can handle nearly any data-related task, from data cleaning and preparation to statistical modeling and machine learning. And because it's open-source, there's a vast ecosystem of packages and tools available to extend its capabilities even further." - Norman Matloff, professor of computer science at the University of California, Davis.

Welcome to my book on R language, designed specifically for auditors who are interested in learning data analytics using open source resources. In today's digital age, data is abundant and ubiquitous, and its importance cannot be overstated. As a result, auditors must be equipped with the necessary skills to leverage this data and draw insights from it. This book is a result of my love for R and my passion for data analytics. In this book, I have tried to present R programming concepts and case studies that are useful in audit analysis as well as forensic audit and fraud investigation.

This book is written based on my notes on R while I was learning the language myself. I have included sufficient figures and examples to make the concepts easy to understand for readers with little or zero knowledge of programming.  Most of the figures have been created by me except a few fore which due credit has been given.

R is an open-source programming language that has been gaining popularity in recent years due to its versatility and flexibility in data analysis. My journey with R began during Covid-19 lockdown, and I was introduced to R for data analysis by one of my colleagues. Since then, R has become an essential tool in my toolbox for data analysis.

I always admire hadley Wickham's contributions to the development of R programming concepts, that has made data analysis more accessible and efficient. The tidyverse, a collection of R packages developed by Wickham, has transformed the way data analysts and data scientists work with data. The tidyverse promotes a consistent and coherent way of working with data, making it easier to write code that is easier to read, understand, and maintain. Wickham's contributions to R have become the foundation of many data analysis tools in other programming languages, including Python and Julia. I hope that this book will inspire readers to explore the vast potential of R and the contributions made by Wickham in data analytics.

One of the advantages of using free/open source tools like R is that they can be easily customized and extended to suit the specific needs of the user. Additionally, free/open source tools are often updated more frequently than licensed tools, ensuring that users have access to the latest features and bug fixes. Using licensed data analytics tools like Caseware IDEA, Tableau, and others can be expensive, and their licensing fees can be a significant burden on smaller organizations or individuals. By using open source tools like R, users can significantly reduce their costs while still having access to powerful data analytics capabilities.

Another strength of R is its extensive library of packages, which includes many tools for statistical analysis and data visualization. In this book, I have tried to make the concepts of R programming and data analytics as accessible as possible for auditors who may have little or zero knowledge of programming. The first part of the book covers R programming concepts which are absolutely necessary to work in R.  Second part onwards covers data wrangling/transformation techniques as well as case studies in forensic audit and fraud investigation using R.

I hope that this book will be a useful resource for auditors who want to learn data analytics using open source resources like R. I invite readers to share their suggestions and comments on the book to help me improve it further.

Happy reading and happy learning!

## Overview {-}
R programming language is the extended version of the S programming language. John Chambers, the creator of the S programming language in 1976 at Bell laboratories. In 1988, the official version of the S language came into existence with the name S-PLUS. The R language is almost the unchanged version of S-PLUS. 

In 1991, R was created by **Ross Ihaka** \index{Ihaka, Ross} and **Robert Gentleman** \index{Gentleman, Robert} in the Department of Statistics at the University of Auckland. Ross’s and Robert’s experience developing R is documented in a 1996 paper in the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics [@10.2307/1390807]. In 1997 the R Core Group was formed, containing some people associated with S and S-PLUS. Currently, the core group controls the source code for R and is solely able to check in changes to the main R source tree. Finally, in 2000 R version 1.0.0 was released to the public. \index{History of R}

## Advantages of R {-}
R programming language is an open-source programming language for statistical computation. It supports n number of statistical analysis techniques, machine learning models, and graphical visualization for data analysis. It serves the purpose of the free software environment for statistical computation and graphics. R is easy to understand and implement. The packages are available to create an effective R program, data models, and graphical charts. For research and analytics purposes,  it is a popular language among statisticians and data scientists.
