# Combining Tables/tabular data

```{r fig.cap="Most of times, joining two or more tables will be required to perform analytics", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/conf.jpg")

```

In real world scenarios, there may hardly be a case when we have to analyse one single table.  There may be cases when we have to either join tables split into multiple smaller tables (e.g. we can have smaller tables split States-wise), or the tables may be divided into various smaller master and transaction tables (relational databases).  

We may thus divide the data tables joining requirements into three broad categories-

- Simple joins or concatenation
- Relational Joins
- Filtering Joins

Let us discuss each of these with examples.

## Simple joins/concatenation
Many times tables split into smaller tables have to be joined back before proceeding further for data analytics.  We may have to join two or more tables either columnwise (e.g. some of the features for all rows have been split into a separate table) or row wise (e.g. all the fields/columns are split into smaller tables like a separate table for each State).  Diagramatically these joins may be depicted as shown in figure \@ref(fig:joins).

```{r joins, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Illustration of Simple joins/concatenation", fig.show='hold', out.width="99%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/concat_joins.png")
```

### Column binding
As we have already seen that data frames act like matrices in many ways except to that fact that these support heterogeneous data unlike matrices.  We have also discussed the ways two matrices can be joined.  Base R has two dedicated functions i.e. `cbind()` and `rbind()` for these operations.

In _tidyverse_ (dplyr specifically) we have two similar functions `bind_cols()` and `bind_rows` respectively which provide us better functionality for these use cases.  The syntax for finction `bind_cols()` used for concatenating two or more tables _column wise_ is -

```
bind_cols(
  ...,
  .name_repair = c("unique", "universal", "check_unique")
)
```
Where -

- `...` represent data frames to be combined
- `.name_repair` argument chooses method to rename duplicate column names, if any.

Example-1:
```{r}
df1 <- iris[1:3, c(1,2,5)]
df2 <- iris[1:3, 3:5]

bind_cols(df1, df2, .name_repair = 'universal')
```

> Note:  The data frames to be merged should be row-consistent for column binding.  Try this `bind_cols(iris[1:3, 1:2], iris[1:4, 3:4])` and see the results.

### Row binding
The syntax used for appending rows of one or more tables together in one table is -

```
bind_rows(..., .id = NULL)
```
where -

- `...` represent data frames to be combined
- `.id` argument creates a new column of identifiers.

To understand it better, let us see this example
```{r}
setosa <- iris[1:3, 1:4]
versicolor <- iris[51:53, 1:4]
virginica <- iris[101:103, 1:4]

bind_rows(setosa, versicolor, virginica, .id = 'groups')
```

> Note: In the above example if the requirement is to store data tables names into the new _identifier_ column just list convert the databases into a list and `.id` will take element_names as the values in identifiers.  Try this `bind_rows(list(setosa=setosa, versicolor=versicolor, virginica=virginica), .id = 'Species')` 

## Relational joins

Relational Joins are usually needed to join multiple tables based on _primary key_ and _secondary keys_.  The joins may either be _one-to-one_ key join or _one-to-many_ key joins.  Broadly these can either be _inner joins_ or _outer joins_. Diagrammatically these may be represented as shown in figure \@ref(fig:joinm) wherein it may be noticed that additional columns from `right` data frame gets appended to `left` data frame.  For this reason, these four joins are also known as mutating joins.

```{r joinm, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Illustration of Mutating Joins in dplyr", fig.show='hold', out.width="99%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mutating_joins.png")
```

The syntax of all these joins is nearly same-
```
*_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, suffix = c('.x', '.y'), ... , keep = FALSE)
```
where -

- `x` and `y` are data frames to be joined
- `by` is a character vector of column names to be joined by
- `suffix` argument provides suffixes to be added to column names, if any of those are duplicate
- `keep` argument decides whether the join keys from both x and y be preserved in the output?

Let's discuss each of these joins individually.

### Inner Joins

Inner Joins keeps only those rows where matching keys are present in both the data frames.

Example-1:
```{r}
band_members
band_instruments

inner_join(band_members, band_instruments)
```

### Left Joins

Left Joins on the other hand preserves all rows of data frame passed as `x` i.e. first argument irrespective of the fact that matching key record is available in second data table or not.

Example-1:
```{r}
left_join(band_members, band_instruments)
```

### Right Joins

Right join, is similar to left join and preserves all rows of data frame passed as `y` i.e. second argument irrespective of the fact that matching key record is available in first data table or not.

Example-1:
```{r}
right_join(band_members, band_instruments)
```

### Full Joins

Full join returns all the rows of both the data tables despite non-availability of matching key in either of the tables.

Example-1:
```{r}
full_join(band_members, band_instruments)
```

You must have noticed that each of the examples shown above has thrown a warning that join has been performed on variable `name`.  We may override this warning by specifically providing the joining _key_ column name(s) in `by` argument i.e. `by = "name"`.

There may be cases when the joining _key_ column(s) in the two data frames are of different names.  These cases can also be handled by using `by` argument.  

Example-
```{r}
band_instruments2
left_join(band_members, band_instruments2, by = c('name' = 'artist'))
```

> Note: Each of the `*_join()` can be joined on multiple keys/columns (i.e. more than one) using `by` argument as explained above.

### Many-to-many Joins {-}
Example of four of the above-mentioned joins are many to many joins and thus need to be used carefully.  See the following example
```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(
  x = c(1, 1, NA),
  y = c(11, 12, 21)
)
df1
df2 <- data.frame(
  x = c(1, 1, NA, NA),
  z = c(101, 102, 201, 202)
)
df2
df1 %>% left_join(df2, by = 'x')
```
In fact, we can use argument `relationship` explicitly to silence this warning and avoid errors.  This argument can take one of these values

- `NULL` (default)
- `"one-to-one"`
- `"one-to-many"`
- `"many-to-one"`
- `"many-to-many"`

Example above re-coded
```{r}
df1 %>% left_join(df2, by = 'x', relationship = "many-to-many")
```



## Filtering Joins
The other joins available in `dplyr` are basically filtering joins.  These joins will not result in appending additional columns present in `right` data frame to `left` data frame.  Only the common keys (columns) from right data frame will be used to filter left data frame.

### Semi Joins

First of these is `semi_join` which essentially filters those rows from a data frame, which are based on another data frame.  See this example-
```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(
  x = c(1, 2, NA),
  y = c(11, 21, 100)
)
df1
df2 <- data.frame(
  x = c(1, 3, 4, NA),
  z = c(101, 301, 401, 501)
)
df2
df1 %>% semi_join(df2, by = 'x')
```

### Anti Joins
The `anti_join` is basically opposite to that of `semi_join`.  It keeps only those records from left data-frame which are not available in right data-frame.  Example
```{r}
df1 %>% anti_join(df2, by = 'x')
```


## Relational, but non-equi joins
Till now, we have learnt joins that use syntax of dplyr version before 1.1.0.  However, in dplyr newest version, 1.1.0, released in January 2023, a new helper function `join_by()` has been introduced.  It actually, constructs a specification that describes how to join two tables using a small domain specific language. The result can be supplied as the by argument to any of the join functions that we have learnt above.  For equal joins, we have learnt above, there are two slight but easier to implement changes if we use `join_by()` -

- we may pass variable names in by argument instead of using characters as described above.
- instead of using `=` we have to use `==` which is actually the equality operator as opposed to assignment operator we were using earlier. 

So our syntax for `left_join` example is
```{r}
band_instruments2
left_join(band_members, band_instruments2, by = join_by(name == artist))
```
Simple, isn't it.  But now using the potential of this new helper function, we can on the other hand join two (or more data frames) using inequality conditions.  

### Inequality Joins
Inequality joins match on an inequality, such as `>`, `>=`, `<`, or `<=`, and are common in time series analysis and genomics. To construct an inequality join using `join_by()`, we have to supply two column names separated by one of the above mentioned inequalities.  See the following example for better understanding of inequality joins.

Example- Suppose we have two tables, one containing product-wise `sales` and another containing `rates` as and when these are revised.  So, in order to have total sales amount, we can use inequality join.

```{r}
# sales
sales <- data.frame(
  product.id = c("A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "B", "B"),
  sales.date = as.Date(c("01-01-2022",
                 "02-02-2022","05-11-2022","05-04-2022",
                 "05-10-2022","01-02-2022","01-01-2023"), format = "%d-%m-%Y"),
  quantity = c(5L, 10L, 15L, 5L, 15L, 1L, 2L)
)
# Print it
sales
# rates
rates <- data.frame(
  product.id = c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B"),
  revision.date = as.Date(c("01-02-2022",
                    "03-04-2022","05-10-2022","01-01-2022",
                    "05-10-2022"), format = "%d-%m-%Y"),
  rate = c(50L, 60L, 70L, 500L, 1500L)
)
#print it
rates

# total sale(1st attempt)
sales %>% 
  left_join(rates,
            by = join_by(product.id,
                         sales.date >= revision.date))
```

We got the results, but the results/rates are obtained fixed on all earlier dates.  To solve this issue, we have **rolling joins**.  See next section.

### Rolling Joins
Rolling joins are a variant of inequality joins that limit the results returned from an inequality join condition. They are useful for "rolling" the closest match forward/backwards when there isn't an exact match. To construct a rolling join, we have to wrap inequality condition with `closest()`.

Above example solved by wrapping date condition in `closest()`
```{r}
sales %>% 
  left_join(rates,
            by = join_by(product.id,
                         closest(sales.date >= revision.date)))
```

We may see that we do not have rates for product `A` for sales made on `01-01-2022`.  

### Overlap Joins
Overlap joins are a special case of inequality joins involving one or two columns from the left-hand table overlapping a range defined by two columns from the right-hand table. There are three helpers that `join_by()` recognizes to assist with constructing overlap joins, all of which can be constructed from simpler inequalities.

- `between(x, y_lower, y_upper, ..., bounds = "[]")` which is just short for `x >= y_lower, x <= y_upper`

- `within(x_lower, x_upper, y_lower, y_upper)` which is just short for `x_lower >= y_lower, x_upper <= y_upper`

- `overlaps(x_lower, x_upper, y_lower, y_upper, ..., bounds = "[]")` which is short for `x_lower <= y_upper, x_upper >= y_lower`

We can make use of these functions as per our need.  

Example-2: Suppose we have `orders` data where we have customer-wise orders, corresponsing order dates and ship dates.  Let us suppose we want to know about customers who placed another order, without waiting for shipping of any of their previous/earlier order.

```{r}
orders <- structure(list(customer_id = c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "C", 
"C"), order_id = 1:7, order_date = c("2019-01-01", "2019-01-05", 
"2019-01-16", "2019-01-05", "2019-01-06", "2019-01-07", "2019-01-09"
), ship_date = c("2019-01-30", "2019-02-10", "2019-01-18", "2019-01-08", 
"2019-01-08", "2019-01-08", "2019-01-10")), row.names = c(NA, 
-7L), class = "data.frame")

# print 
orders

# customers who placed the orders without
# waiting to ship their earlier order
orders %>% 
  inner_join(orders,
             by = join_by(customer_id,
                          overlaps(order_date, ship_date, order_date, ship_date),
                          order_id < order_id)) 
```

### Example uses of rolling joins.

**The content is under development.**

### Cross Joins
This join matches everything with everything and therefore can be thought of as a cross product of two data frames. We can use `cross_join` for this special join.  If we have `m` and `n` rows in two data frames, then as a result of cross join we will have `m*n` rows.

Example-
```{r}
df <- data.frame(products = c('A', 'B', 'C'))

df %>% 
  cross_join(df)
```
