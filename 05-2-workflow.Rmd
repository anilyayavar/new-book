# File handling operations in R {#file}

In chapter \@ref(read) we have already learned about reading and writing data from/to files.  In this section, we will learn about some other functions that are useful while reading and writing data, such as - changing directory, creating a file, renaming a file, check the existence of the file, listing all files in the working directory, copying files and creating directories.

## Handling files

### Creating a file within R, using `file.create()` 

Using `file.create()` function\index{file.create() function}, we can create a new file from console.  If the file already exists it truncates. The function returns a `TRUE` logical value if file is created otherwise, returns `FALSE`.

Example - The following command will create a blank text file in the current working directory.

```{r}
file.create("my_new_text_file.txt")
```

### Checking whether a file exists, using `file.exists()`

Similar to above, we can check whether a file with given name exists, using function\index{file.exists() function} `file.exists()`.  Example- 

```{r}
file.exists("my_new_text_file.txt")
```

### Renaming file with `file.rename()`

The file name can be changed within the R console using, function\index{file.rename() function} `file.rename()`.  Basic syntax is `file.rename(from = "old_name", to = "new_name")`.  The function will return `TRUE` or `FALSE` depending upon the successful execution. See example

```{r}
file.rename(from = "my_new_text_file.txt", to = "my_renamed_file.csv")
# Check whether old file exists
file.exists("my_new_text_file.txt")
```

### Copying file with `file.copy()` function
Using `file.copy(from = "old_path", to = "new_path")` syntax \index{file.copy() function} files can be copied from one directory to another.

### Deleting file with `file.remove()`

The syntax for function\index{file.remove() function}, that removes a file with given name, is also very simple.  Example-

```{r}
file.remove("my_renamed_file.csv")
```
Check whether the file has been really deleted.
```{r}
file.exists("my_renamed_file.csv")
```

## Handling directories

### Get/Set path of current working directory using `getwd()`/ `setwd()`

We can check/get the path of current working directory (wd in short) as a character vector, using `getwd()` \index{getwd() function} function.

```{r}
getwd()
```
Similarly, using `setwd("given\\path\\here")` we can change the current working directory.\index{setwd() function}

> Two things to be noted here - Either the path is to be given using forward slash `/` or if backslash `\` is used these need to be escaped, using an extra `\` as `\` is itself an escape character in R.

### Create new directory using `dir.create()` and other operations

A new directory can be created using function\index{dir.create() function} `dir.create()`.  Example- the command below will create a new directory named 'new_dir' in the current working directory. If `TRUE` is returned, directory with given name is created.

```{r}
dir.create("new_dir")
```

We can check whether any directory named 'new_dir' exists in current working directory, using function\index{dir.exists() function} `dir.exists()` function.  Function will return either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

```{r}
dir.exists("new_dir")
```

We can also check all files that exists in current working directory/any other directory using `list.files()`\index{list.files() function} function.

```{r}
any(list.files() == 'new_dir')
```

A given directory can be removed using `unlink()` function\index{unlink() function} be specifically setting argument `recursive` to `TRUE`.  Example
```{r}
unlink("new_dir", recursive = TRUE)
dir.exists("new_dir")
```

## An important function for opening a dialog box for selecting files and folder

We may use either of `choose.dir()`\index{choose.dir() function} or `file.choose()`\index{file.choose() function}, to let the user select directory or file of her/his choice respectively.

Try these in your console
```
list.files(choose.dir())
file.copy(from = file.choose(), to = "new_name")
```

## Other useful functions for listing/removing variables
We can list all the variables available in current environment using function `ls()`\index{ls() function}.  Another function `rm()`\index{rm() function} will remove the given variables.  So a command like `rm(lm())` will remove all the available variables from the environment(Use this will caution as it will erase all the saved variables/data).  

## Using `save()` to save objects/collection of objects
We can save objects using function `save()` \index{save() function}which saves the objects on disk for later usage.  The saved objects can be retrieved using `load()`\index{load() function} function.  See this example-
```{r fig.show='hide'}
h <- hist(Nile)
save(h, file="nile_hist")
rm(h)
any(ls() == 'h')
load("nile_hist")
any(ls() == 'h')
```


## Projects
While working on a project, often a requirement is to keep all scripts, data, results, charts, figures, etc. at a single place.  R studio has thus, a concept of working in projects\index{Projects in R Studio}, which associates a specific directory with a specific project and creates a specific file with extension `.Rproj`, which can reopen the complete scripts/ data/ etc. associated with that project.  

To open a new project in Rstudio, click `file` menu then `New Project`.  Check the following screenshots-

```{r fig.cap="Creating Projects in R Studio", echo=FALSE, out.width="49%", out.height="49%", fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/Rproj1.png", "images/Rproj2.png"))
```

After Creating the projects you will notice that a file with an extension `.Rproj` has been created by R Studio in the selected directory/location of project.  

To resume working in the same project directory, either double click the file, or open the project using file menu i.e. `file` $->$ `Open Project`.
